I‚Äôm Chunyi Li(ÊùéÊò•‰∏Ä), a joint Ph.D. Student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University under the supervision of Prof. [Guangtao Zhai](https://ee.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FacultyDetail.aspx?id=24&infoid=153&flag=153) (IEEE Fellow), and Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of Prof. [Weisi Lin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wslin/Home.html) (IEEE Fellow).

See my top Repos:
- ü•á[AIGC Quality Evaluation](https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/AGIQA-3k-Database): a comprehensive fine-grained AI-Generated Image (AIGC) subjective quality assessment database. (100+ citations)
- üß∞[Embodied AI Evaluation](https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/MPD): the first subjective evaluation paradigm from human to machine. (CVPR Ratings: 555)
üì´ Reach me by e-mail: lcysyzxdxc@sjtu.edu.cn, lich0076@e.ntu.edu.sg

My research interests cover the Generative AI/Embodied AI evaluation and their low-level downstream application. I'm a regular reviewer for journals: TPAMI/JSAC/TIP/TMM/TCSVT/TNNLS/TOMM, and conferences: CVPR/ICCV/NIPS/ICLR/ACMMM/ICME, etc.
